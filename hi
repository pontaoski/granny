This is a sample Orchard program.
Orchard is the assembler for Granny.

Granny starts the program counter at 1, so let's pad to there.

|1

---

This is where our program starts: we jump to the main loop.

---

    &mainLoop
    Jump

---

We define our two print functions: print:Z and print:Newline.

---

:print

    @Z
        'z
        #0 IOAct
        Ret

    @Newline
        '\n
        #0 IOAct
        Ret

---

Now we define the Main program loop:

---

:mainLoop
    &print:Z Call

    &print:Newline Call

    &mainLoop Jump
